		<h1> Graeme Stroud </h1>

		<p> I am a first-year Masters student (MMath) at the University of Waterloo. I am in the Algorithms and Complexity group within the Department of Computer Science. I completed my B.Sc at the University of Toronto.
		</p>

		<h2> About Me </h2>

    <p>I was born in raised in Toronto, Ontario. As a child, I enjoyed swimming (for fun and occasionally in swim meets),
      camping and other outdoor activities<!--learning--> as a Boy Scout, and watching
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WZLJpMOxS4" style="text-decoration:none">cartoons</a>.
      Before attending University of Toronto, I went to Bowmore Public School and Danforth Collegiate and Technical
      Institute.

			<h2> School </h2>

      <p><!--I went to high school at Danforth Collegiate Technical Institute.-->
        At Danforth Collegiate,
        I was in the MaST program.
        I was the top student in Calculus and Chemistry. I volunteered in the after school "Math Clinic" program, helping
        other students study for their math courses (believe me, I was very cool in high school).

        Along with three other Danforth students, I participated in a high school outreach program run by the
        University of Toronto Aerospace Team (UTAT). We designed and built a 1U CubeSat as a deployable payload for a hybrid sounding rocket.
        The payload would record data about its path, orientation, and flight exterior conditions
        during flight though activation of an Arduino-based circuit during deployment, which I was in charge of programming.
      </p>

			<p>I just completed my senior year at the University of Toronto,
				with a Computer Science Specialist and a Mathematics Minor.
				I TA'd CSC263 in the winter 2019 term. I was a member of the Undergraduate Theory Group, where I planned social and course-related events.
				I graduated this June with a H.B.Sc. in Computer Science with high distinction.</p>

			<h2> Research </h2>

			<p> I am currently a student under <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~alubiw/"> Anna Lubiw</a>, focusing in Computational Geometry.</p>

			<p>During my undergraduate, I worked with <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~anikolov/"> Aleksandar Nikolov </a> on a project
				in the research area of Discrepancy Theory. We explored different geometric discrepancy approximation algorithms.
				In particular we looked at algorithms for halfspaces and how they could be improved. We deduced a tight lower bound for a costly
				subprocedure of the algorithm, suggesting there is not much room for improvement for the algorithm. Soon you can read more about
				my work <a href="./CSC494_report.pdf">here</a>. </p>

			<!--h2>Courses and Projects</h2>
				<p>I have taken many exciting courses at UofT and UWaterloo.</p-->

			<!--h2>Programming Skills</h2>
				<p>Over the past few years I have accumulated a diverse set of valuable programming skills. </p-->

			<h2>Hobbies and Clubs</h2>

				<!--p>Clubs: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/uoft.utg/?ref=br_rs"> Undergraduate Theory group</a></p-->
				<p>Clubs: Nothing (yet) at UWaterloo! </p>

				<p> Hobbies: Swimming, saxophone, kayaking. Watching (too much) TV in my spare time.</p>
